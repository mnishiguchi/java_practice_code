## The javac and java commands
http://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~newhall/unixhelp/debuggingtips_Java.html

### Compiling files
- Use the **javac** command.
- Convert source code (.java file) to byte code (.class file). 
- Automatically creates .class files with appropriate filenames.

### Running a Java program
- Use the **java** command with the name of the class that contains the program's main method.
- Filename must have the extension .class
